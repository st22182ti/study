    <p>Bees can actually tell each other which way to swarm. <br>They can't talk about where anything else is, and they can't convey concepts. <br>There's just this one thing—absolutely miraculous—that allows them to communicate that one way about that one thing. <br>That is communication, but bees cannot "chew the fat." <br>They only do that one thing. <br>That's one level of communication, but it's not exactly language.</p>

    <p>Language is more than words, it is also how the words are put together—grammar. <br>Grammar allows us to put words together to produce utterances that reflect our impressions of our lives, experiences, and environment, as well as enable us to affect people and events around us. <br>One can learn hundreds of words in a foreign language and still be unable to manage even a simple conversation or even say, "You might as well finish it" or "It happened to be on a Tuesday."</p>

    <p>Communication among lower animals is not "language" in the human sense. <br>The philosopher Bertrand Russell once wrote, "A dog cannot relate his autobiography; however eloquently he may bark, he cannot tell you that his parents were honest though poor." <br>But a bee tells the hive about honey it has found by doing certain dances. <br>In one, the bee moves in a straight line in the direction that the honey is in and waggles its behind with a frequency corresponding to how far away the honey is and with a "liveliness" corresponding to how rich the source is. <br>Is this "language"? <br>Bees only communicate in this manner about the location of food. <br>They cannot chew the fat.</p>

    <p>Apes seem eerily like us, and this includes their ability to communicate with us on certain levels. <br>In his famously colloquial, quotidian diary, Samuel Pepys, man of affairs of Restoration England, wrote:</p>

    <p class="pepys-quote">It is a great baboon, but so like a man in most things, that... yet I cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon. <br>I do believe it already understands much English; and I am of the mind it might be taught to speak or make signs.</p>
    <p class="citation">(Latham, R.C., and W. Matthews, eds. The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Vol. 2. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970.)</p>

    <p>In actuality, when people have tried to teach chimpanzees to talk, the results have been limited. <br>In 1909, one chimp learned to say mama. <br>In 1916, an orangutan learned to say papa and cup. <br>In the 1940s, another chimp learned to say papa, mama, cup, and sometimes up. <br>More recently, researchers have tried to teach chimpanzees sign language. <br>The results have been somewhat more successful. <br>Starting in 1966, Washoe, at about a year old, took three months to make her first signs, and by four, she had 132 signs. <br>She could extend open from referring to a door to opening containers and turning on faucets, and she once signed water bird when a swan passed. <br>She could even put a few words together into "sentences," such as "you me out" for "Let's go out." <br>But these chimpanzees are not using "language" in the human sense. <br>They tend to respond properly to strings of two or more words only most of the time rather than all of the time.</p>

    <p>Some researchers have argued that understanding these strings of words shows that chimpanzees are using "grammar" in the sense of subject versus object and so on. <br>But the correspondence between the words and the immediate context generally makes the meaning of the string clear without any sense of "grammar." <br>One ape knew that "cooler sour cream put" meant, "Put the sour cream in the cooler," but obviously, this was the only rational meaning those words used together could have. <br>One ape signed along with humans while they were communicating with him 40 percent of the time, while children overlap with adults speaking to them only about 5 percent of the time. <br>This suggests that chimpanzees are imitating more than speaking on their own.</p>
